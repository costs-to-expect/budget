                    <h2>Building up Savings</h2>

                    <p>
                        It’s always a good idea to put money away for a rainy day.
                        Creating a budget which includes savings can help
                        give you the discipline to save regularly. Being able to see your savings grow can be really motivating.

                        be the time to put a budget in place. When we got engaged, this was when our budgeting journey

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        According to

                    <h2>Applying for a Mortgage</h2>

                    <p>
                        Planning to buy a house and apply for a mortgage is another reason to start budgeting.
                        Tracking your finances will help you to evidence your income and outgoings to your
                        mortgage advisor. It will also help you to understand the impact of any mortgage
                        repayments on your monthly budget.

                    <h2>Extending your Family</h2>

                    <p>
                        Welcoming a new bundle of joy into the family is an exciting time! Your financial
                        situation will inevitably change but putting a budgeting plan in place will help you
                        to manage any extra costs. As our boys have grown, we’ve also put together some tips for
                        teaching kids about money and budgeting.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you’re kids are approaching their teenage years (good luck!), now is a great time to have them learn about
                        how to manage their money and start budgeting. Make sure they check out our

                    <h2>Preparing for Christmas and Seasonal Events</h2>

                    <p>
                        Yes, they come around every year but seasonal events like Christmas or Eid can have a
                        negative impact on our finances and end up causing unnecessary stress and debt.  A budget can 
                        help you manage festive spending by planning ahead and setting realistic limits.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Control Impulse Spending</h2>

                    <p>
                        Creating a budget and tracking your expenses will help you if you’re in the habit of
                        spending impulsively on things you really don’t need.  Having a budget helps you to stop
                        overspending and keep control of your money.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Prepare for the unexpected</h2>

                    <p>Life is full of surprises and having a budget can help you to be prepared for life’s
                        curve balls, which otherwise might leave you panicking. So whether it’s an appliance
                        which needs to be replaced, the car needing repairs or even a divorce, having a budget
                        can help prepare you for the unexpected events that creep up on us all.</p>

                    <h2>Staying out of Debt</h2>

                    <p>
                        We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again:
                        Budgeting is about making a plan for your money.
                        And with a clear plan for your spending, you’re more likely to stay out of debt. However,
                        if you are already in debt, having a budget can help you to control spending in order to
                        pay off loans as quickly as possible.
                    </p>
